<p>The development of an organism … may be considered as the execution of a 'developmental program' present in the fertilized egg. … A central task of developmental biology is to discover the underlying algorithm from the course of development.

<a id="algorithm" class="anchor" href="#algorithm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm</h1>

<p>It's simple, <strong>Algorithm</strong> is a routine made by some people to solve some problems and we learn them because they are considred the best ways to solve this kind of problems for sure if you are smart enough you can invent your own algorithm but first we learn some then we make some it's called analysis then design . </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>
You have a problem to go from home to work, you will start thinking which is the best way to go their using a car or on foot.
if you are not late you will save some money and go on foot if you are cheap like me, but if you are late you will use the car and pay much more but you will save time since you need it.</p>

<p><strong>What you learn form this</strong> ? </p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithm is just a way to solve problems.</li>
<li>Choosing an algorithem depends on the situation you are in and the problem you are faceing right now.</li>
<li>Make your own algorithem or way to solve thing after you know how to use some algorithm this should give you some experince.</li>
</ul>

<a id="computer-algorithm" class="anchor" href="#computer-algorithm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer algorithm</h2>

<p>It's algorithm used to solve problems related to computer, simple one like sorting a group of numbers to more complex one like data mining.
Now i will introduce you at this chapter to one of these problem which is sorting.</p>

<h2>
<a id="sorting" class="anchor" href="#sorting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sorting</h2>

<p>Since i am programmer i will start by identifying what is the problem so i can solve it,
<strong>Sorting</strong> is the problem if representing numbers or alphabetic in the wrong order and your goal is to make them in the right order and i think it's the best problem to start solving using a simple alogorithm.</p>

<h2>
<a id="first-algorithm-bubble-sort" class="anchor" href="#first-algorithm-bubble-sort" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First algorithm: Bubble sort</h2>

<p>it's a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted</p>

<ol>
<strong>Oh, Lets have some fun</strong> 
<li>Get some playing cards or make some if you don't have one.</li>
<li>choose 8 different card that represent a number.</li>
<li>put them in the wrong order so we can start sorting them. </li>
<li>compares each pair of adjacent cards and swap them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
<li>go through this process over and over until they are in the right order.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#/media/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif">Check this out if you need some help</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Now it's time to answer some questions and make this problem into a running program i will use <strong>Java</strong> to make my program, you can use any programming language you want but first lets start with the questions.</p>

<ol>
<strong>Answer me</strong>
<li> What is the maximum number of operation you have to take so that our 8 numbers are sorted whatever the value of these number are </li>
<li> Do you think there is a better method to sort this numbers you use?. if yes tell me what they are. </li>
</ol>
