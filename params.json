The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted\r\n\r\n<ol><strong>Oh, Lets have some fun</strong> \r\n<li>Get some playing cards or make some if you don't have one.</li>\r\n<li>choose 8 different card that represent a number.</li>\r\n<li>put them in the wrong order so we can start sorting them. </li>\r\n<li>compares each pair of adjacent cards and swap them if they are in the wrong order.</li>\r\n<li>go through this process over and over until they are in the right order.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n[Check this out if you need some help](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#/media/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow it's time to answer some questions and make this problem into a running program i will use <strong>Java</strong> to make my program, you can use any programming language you want but first lets start with the questions.\r\n\r\n<ol><strong>Answer me</strong>\r\n<li> What is the maximum number of operation you have to take so that our 8 numbers are sorted whatever the value of these number are </li>\r\n<li> Do you think there is a better method to sort this numbers you use?. if yes tell me what they are. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Code \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\r\n    public class App {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n            /// variables ///\r\n            int[] sort_me = {6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4};\r\n            long startingTime, elapsedTime;\r\n\r\n            /// let's print the array before sorting ///\r\n            System.out.println(\"ARRAY BEFORE SORTING\");\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < sort_me.length; i++) {\r\n                System.out.println(\"Array[\" + i + \"]= \" + sort_me[i]);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            System.out.println(); // let's make it look good\r\n\r\n            startingTime = System.nanoTime();\r\n\r\n            // Bubble sort algorithm ///\r\n\r\n            for (int operation_number = 0; operation_number < sort_me.length - 1; operation_number++) {\r\n                for (int element = 0; element< sort_me.length - 1; element++ ) {\r\n                    if (sort_me[element] > sort_me[element + 1]) {\r\n\r\n                        /// Swapping ///\r\n                        int temporary = sort_me[element];\r\n                        sort_me[element] = sort_me[element + 1];\r\n                        sort_me[element + 1] = temporary;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            elapsedTime = System.nanoTime() - startingTime;\r\n\r\n\r\n            /// let's print the array before sorting ///\r\n            System.out.println(\"ARRAY AFTER SORTING\");\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < sort_me.length; i++) {\r\n                System.out.println(\"Array[\" + i + \"]= \" + sort_me[i]);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            System.out.println(\"Time required : \" +elapsedTime/6 + \" Millisecond\");\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
