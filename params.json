The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted\r\n\r\n<ol><strong>Oh, Lets have some fun</strong> \r\n<li>Get some playing cards or make some if you don't have one.</li>\r\n<li>choose 8 different card that represent a number.</li>\r\n<li>put them in the wrong order so we can start sorting them. </li>\r\n<li>compares each pair of adjacent cards and swap them if they are in the wrong order.</li>\r\n<li>go through this process over and over until they are in the right order.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n[Check this out if you need some help](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#/media/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow it's time to answer some questions and make this problem into a running program i will use <strong>Java</strong> to make my program, you can use any programming language you want but first lets start with the questions.\r\n\r\n<ol><strong>Answer me</strong>\r\n<li> What is the maximum number of operation you have to take so that our 8 numbers are sorted whatever the value of these number are </li>\r\n<li> Do you think there is a better method to sort this numbers you use?. if yes tell me what they are. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Code \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
